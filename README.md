- About
	- This is a term project defined by the professor.
	- Collaborated with a South Jersey business owner to design and develop 
	a software product that would enhance their work processes.
	
- Goal
	- Create an application that allows users to manage products, customer information, and orders 
	using JavaFX and MySQL.
	- This will give the business owner a digital way to keep track of inventory, customers, and orders.
	
> I, Collyz, have updated the project after the term ended to better follow the MVC architecture of JavaFX.
	- Some updates include:
	- Only allowing a single admin user to exist
	- No more formatting issues since tables are used
	- Proper resizing implemented
	- Bulk Order tab information is much more intuitive
	- Searches are more intuitive and responsive
